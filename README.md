# The Political Oracle

### Ethan Cheng & Johnny So

We've decided to use the Huffington Post
[Pollster](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api) API for data on
political poll.

We'll be crunching data by state and primary elections and displaying them in a bar graph
and pie chart. The main interactivity feature of this d3js project is the ability to
click on any of the bars in the bar graph and it will generate the same pie chart
for any given bar, displaying the breakdown of each candidate's votes.

Our name, The Political Oracle, is based on the fact that the Huffington Post API
is quite....interesting in how it gets its data for votes not yet conducted.
