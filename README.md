# The Political Oracle

### Ethan Cheng & Johnny So

We've decided to use the Huffington Post
[Pollster](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api) API for data on
political poll.

We'll be crunching data by state and primary elections and displaying them in a
line graph, but the goal is to use machine learning with the political trends to
predict future election results.
